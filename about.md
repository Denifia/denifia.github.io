I'm a happy-go-lucky type of guy that enjoys learning, challenge and winning. These combined to fuel my constant need to explore new skills and hobbies. In my professional life, I'm a Software Development Consultant with over a decade of experience.

Don't expect regular posts; I when I feel the urge and have something interesting (to me) to write about.
