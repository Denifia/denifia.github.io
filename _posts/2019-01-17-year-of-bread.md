title: Year of bread
---
I've been on and off baking bread for about three years now. Most of the time the end result is good but generally inconsistent. I keep changing recipes, mixing recipes, not following recipes, using various brands of ingridents and changing my technique.

I like bread. I like eating and making bread. I love a challenge. And so...

**This year I've decided that I'll bake 100 loaves of bread!**

Luckily that works out to only be about 2 every week, so I feel it's very doable as long as I don't skip too many weeks over the year.

My aim is to not worry about what recipe I use or how the bread turns out. I want to instead focus on ensuring that I can consistently integrate making (and eating) into my weekly routine.
