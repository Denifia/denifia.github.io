title: Fasting for health and clarity
published: true

Last week I completed a ~~seven~~ three day [water fast][water-fast] as an experiment to see what benefits or issues would arise. I knew this would not be overly dangerous because humans can survive a _long_ time without food (in one particular case, a full year!). This is what I experienced:

* Periodic bursts of energy
* Extended periods of mental clarity and focus (usually most of the day)
* General feeling of being "tighter" and healthier
* Hunger

The hunger hit me every 3-4 hours but would only last 30-60 minutes at a go. I love a challenge and am stubborn by nature so these bursts of hunger didn't really phase me. Instead, they made me realise how much my body was trying to make me eat even when I didn't actually need the food.
