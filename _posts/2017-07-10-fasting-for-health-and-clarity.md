title: Fasting for health and clarity

Last week I completed a ~~seven~~ three day [water fast][water-fast] as an experiment to see what benefits or issues would arise. I knew this would not be overly dangerous because humans can survive a _long_ time without food (in one particular case, a full year!).<!--more--> This is what I experienced:

* Periodic bursts of energy
* Extended periods of mental clarity and focus (usually most of the day)
* General feeling of being "tighter" and healthier
* Hunger

The hunger hit me every 3-4 hours but would only last 30-60 minutes at a go. I love a challenge and am stubborn by nature so these bursts of hunger didn't really phase me. Instead, they made me realise how much my body was trying to make me eat even when I didn't actually need the food.

I felt higher levels of focus and mental clarity (even without coffee!) starting from the afternoon of the second day. It was most noticable when I was on my 1 hour drive to and from work.
